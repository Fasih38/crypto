Supply
Total supply
Market Cap
Fully diluted value (FDV)
Emissions(the release of a token over time): If a token is released in 3 months, then big dumps. If max supply hits in 10 years then it's very good. (In whitepaper).
Emissions by Staking Rewards, Airdrops, User Rewards, Token Unlocks.
Distribution : If the coins of early investors unlock in 3 months then it's very bad.
----------------------------------------------
- Best Distribution:
Team: 15% or less
Advisors: Less than 10%
Early Investors(Seed, VC, Strategic, Private, KOL, Angel): Less than 25%
Public sale: Less than 10%
Marketing: 10% or less
Ecosystem(Staking, Yield Farming, Airdrops): At least 10%
Treasury: At least 15%
Liquidity(Locked for 2 year): 20% or less
----------------------------------------------
Vesting in cryptocurrency is the process of locking away tokens or coins for a set period of time.
Vesting Overs a couple of years.
TGE (Token Generation Event):
Less than 10% at TGE for early investors & 3 month Cliff Period.
Cliff Period (Time before token unlock begins)
----------------------------------------------
Demand:
Incentives for Holding:
(APY of token)
Store of value
Community:
Twitter/Discord/Telegram
Utility: Utility in crypto refers to the use of cryptocurrency assets to provide access to a specific function or service within a blockchain ecosystem.
Who is holding?
One person holding too much is dangerous.
---------------------------
Value Accrual:
Deflation(Decreasing supply): Transaction fees + burning
Locking Mechanisms: Decent APY + Users Stake
Utility Expansion(use case expand): Future roadmap
APR/APY/Yield(30% APY is bad)
Low Inflation
—---------------
Look for a finite supply of tokens.
Strong demand for incentivized Holding, good community, and Utility
Value Accrual Mechanisms
—---------------
